Books that I've read and can recommend

[NND] M.Hagan H.Demuth - Neural Network Design (2nd Edition) - extremally cheap (~25$ on Amazon) but super usefull, also contains introduction into linear algebra

[Haykin-NNLM] S.Haykin Neural Networks and Learning Machines (3rd Edition) - quite classical from famous author, has a lot of references. I think NND is better to start with neural networks
